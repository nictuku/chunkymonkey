Chunky Monkey is a Minecraft Beta multiplayer server.  It is licensed under
the MIT open source license, please see the LICENSE file for more information.

Website: http://github.com/huin/chunkymonkey
Contact: [John Beisley][3]

Status
------

Chunky Monkey is currently in early development and does not yet run anything
that could be considered a full game experience.

Worlds generated by Alpha or Beta Notchian clients can be loaded by the server.

Minecraft Beta clients may:

*   Connect and walk around the existing generated parts of a world.
*   Blocks may be dug, items picked up, and blocks placed.
*   Craft using the 2x2 or 3x3 crafting grids.

Currently missing features include:

*   Block physics.
*   Complete item physics (there is a minimal implementation in place).
*   Mobs.
*   Most block interactions.
*   World persistency.
*   World generation.


Contributing
------------

Chunky Monkey is looking for assistance in furthering its development.

Key skills:

*   Use of Git and Github.
*   Moderate skill in the Go programming language.
*   Ability to write clear, maintainable code.
*   Unit testing knowledge.
*   Understanding of goroutine concurrency primitives.

Highly desireable skills:

*   Cellular automata for the purposes of world block physics.
*   Embedding a scripting environment (perhaps Lua?) into Go.
*   Low-latency reliable network communication.
*   Server scalabilty and reliability architecture.
*   Service monitoring.
*   World generation (including noise generation).

If you're interested in working on the project - it's best to contact [Huin][3]
via Github, or on the Freenode IRC network in the #mcdevs channel.


Requirements
------------

The [Go toolchain][1] must be installed.


Building
--------

[Godag][2] is used to build chunkymonkey. Install it, and run:

    $ make

Running
-------

Serve up a single player world:

    $ ./chunkymonkey ~/.minecraft/saves/World1
    2010/10/03 16:32:13 Listening on  :25565

Record/replay
-------------

For debugging it is often useful to record a player's actions and replay them
one or more times later.  This makes it possible to simulate multiplayer games
without having real people logging in.

To record a session:

    $ ./chunkymonkey --record player.log ~/.minecraft/saves/World1

To replay a session:

    $ ./chunkymonkey --replay player.log ~/.minecraft/saves/World1 &
    $ java -jar Minecraft.jar  # start the first player (real human)
    $ nc localhost 25565       # start the second player (replay from log file)

The recorded player will start when the second client connects to the server.
Use netcat or a similar tool to start an otherwise idle TCP connection to the
server.
